2.4.0.0 - 12 Nov 2014

  * Changed parameter binding implementation to fix bugs with wide character strings and binary
    data not handled well with Microsoft SQL Server on Windows.

  * Implemented atomic reference counting to avoid race conditions in native code when running
    with -threaded

  * Implemented workaround for the SQL Server ODBC Driver deadlock, which occured if cursor over a
    statement that was in the process of fetching data over the network got closed.
